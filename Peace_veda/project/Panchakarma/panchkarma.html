  <!-- Panchakarma About -->
  <section class="panch-abt">
    Panchakarma (पञ्चकर्म) is a core healing and detoxification therapy in Ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine. The word Panchakarma literally means “five actions” (Pancha = five, Karma = actions/therapies). These five therapeutic procedures are designed to cleanse the body of accumulated toxins (Ama), restore balance to the doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha), and rejuvenate overall health.
